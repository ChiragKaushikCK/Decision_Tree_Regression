# Decision_Tree_Regression

Decision tree regression is a machine learning algorithm that uses a tree-like structure to make predictions for continuous output variables.

Here's a simple way to think about it:

Splitting Data: Imagine you have a dataset with many features (like age, income, education) and a target variable you want to predict (like house price). A decision tree starts by looking for the best way to split your data into two groups based on one of the features. For example, it might split based on "Age < 30" vs. "Age >= 30".

Creating Branches: Each split creates a "branch" in the tree. The goal of each split is to make the data within each new group (or "node") as similar as possible in terms of the target variable.

Repeating the Process: The algorithm then repeats this splitting process on each of the new groups, creating more branches and nodes. It continues until it reaches a point where further splitting doesn't significantly improve the "purity" of the groups, or a stopping criterion (like a maximum depth for the tree) is met.

Making Predictions: When you want to make a prediction for a new data point, you follow the branches of the tree based on its features until you reach a "leaf node" (a node with no further splits). The prediction for that data point is typically the average (or mean) of the target variable values of all the training data points that ended up in that same leaf node
